## Release notes for kOps 1.28 series

# Significant changes

## AWS

* Node Termination Handler is now enabled by default.

## GCP

* [metadata-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/metadata-proxy) is no longer deployed on GCP clusters for Kubernetes 1.29+.

# Breaking changes

## AWS

* The `kops get assets --copy` command no longer sets object-level public-read ACLs in the destination fileRepository.

## OpenStack

* If storing the state in an S3 bucket, it is now required to either [deactivate gossip support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/15684#issuecomment-1645384421) (`--dns=none`) or - for example - provide the credentials via cloud-init. Due to changes in [PR#15646](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/15646/files#diff-c1c852aea92883d3117fae99c1610c5cdcbc217f5aa3b340f23b5dd02e971d99L136-L145) the `S3_*` variables will not get passed on to the boot script of the [nodes anymore](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/15691). As a result the `kops-configuration.service` will throw an `EnvAccessKeyNotFound: failed to find credentials in the environment.` error and they will not join the cluster. Deactivating the gossip support will make the nodes contact the API servers for the bootstrap information.

## Other breaking changes

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.22 has been removed.

* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 is has been removed.

* Support for Canal, Flannel, and Kube-Router has been removed for Kubernetes 1.28 and later.

* RHEL-based distros will no longer have `wget`, `curl`, `python2`, and `git` packages installed. Install them with [hooks](/cluster_spec/#hooks) if needed.

* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).
