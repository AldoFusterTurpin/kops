# Significant changes

## Initial OpenTelemetry Support

We are starting to add (experimental) support for OpenTelemetry,
in particular Tracing support.  Setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_FILE`
will write a trace file which can then be read by the traceserver program.
More information and options are described in [docs/opentelemetry.md](/docs/opentelemetry.md).
The tracing data is not expected to be particularly useful for end-users in
this release; the (non-standard) recording approach is instead intended to
work well with our Prow end-to-end testing system so that developers can
optimize kOps.

Please note: this is *not* telemetry in the "phone-home" sense.
The kOps project does not collect data from your machine.  As an
open-source project we do not even want to collect any of your data.
Currently the only OpenTelemetry backend supported is writing to a
filesystem (and it is opt-in).  In future you will be able to configure
other OpenTelemetry backends, but this data will only be sent if
you enable OpenTelemetry, and only sent to where you configure.

## AWS

* Network Load Balancers in front of the Kubernetes API and bastion hosts now
have a security group attached. These security groups are used for security group rules
allowing incoming traffic to the NLBs as well as traffic between the NLBs and their target
instances.

## GCP

* As of Kubernetes version 1.29, credentials for private GCR/AR repositories will be handled by the out-of-tree credential provider. This is an additional binary that each instance downloads from the assets repository.

## Openstack
